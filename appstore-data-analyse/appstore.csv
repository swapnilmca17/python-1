We’ll tackle any topic, analyze any situation and have our readers weigh in with their input. And the speed of the Internet makes covering current subjects immediate – no waiting three months for an opinion to appear in print.Air Facts needs you.Here’s the amazing difference in Air Facts. It’s primarily reader-written. Yes, aviation icon Richard Collins continues to share his unbelievable wealth of information on flying, technique, weather and a host of other topics, but the majority of articles are supplied by you, the reader.By the way, we have fun too!Check out our regular series on Go/No Go where you decide whether a particular flight is safe to take. There’s no right or wrong answer – you decide. We write about our mistakes, our lessons learned and the pure joy of what it means to be a pilot. Our readers write about their trips – at Air Facts, you climb in, buckle up and ride along. Air Facts covers serious topics, but we don’t take ourselves too seriously. We know that pilots are always learning.Thanks, Sporty’s, for Air FactsAir Facts is brought to you by Sporty’s Pilot Shop and the production and distribution is directed by John Zimmerman, an accomplished pilot and aircraft owner. John writes for Air Facts as well – his own blog and other articles too. Plus John is the one who creates the intriguingly entertaining Go/No Go’s, many based on his own experiences.We publish issues every two weeks.

Ildsjelen Grini,"Ildsjelen er et magasin for LIVSKRAFT, BEVISSTHET og ÅNDELIGHET.Ildsjelen utkommer 6 ganger i året og er på 68 sider. Ildsjelen er et frittstående magasin som ikke bundet til noen religioner eller retninger.Ildsjelen er opptatt av å øke menneskenes bevissthetsnivå, både individuelt og kollektivt. Vi lever i en turbulent tid med enorme utfordringer som ikke kan løses med å bruke samme tanker, forståelse og metoder. Et sitat fra Albert Einstein summerer derfor kort opp intensjonen med Ildsjelen:”Ingen problemer kan noensinne løses fra samme bevissthetsnivå som skapte det.”Ildsjelen tar for seg nye åndelige tanker og strømninger, og vil samtidig bevare og belyse tidløs visdom. Ildsjelen ønsker å være en støttespiller i den åndelige utviklingen og oppvåkningen som menneskeheten er i ferd med å gjennomgå. Ildsjelen ser på mennesket som et åndelig vesen i en fysisk kropp. Noe av det Ildsjelen er opptatt av:SPIRITUALITETMYSTERIEREN NY JORDMENNESKETS POTENSIALVi mennesker er bare i startfasen med å oppdage og utforske vårt enorme potensial. Vi står nå foran et kvantesprang i vår utvikling som Ildsjelen vil være en støttespiller til.Noen temaer Ildsjelen tar opp:- Helhetlig og holistisk livssyn- Trancendale erfaringer- Selvutvikling- Mysterier- En ny åndelighet- Positive nyheter- Intervjuer- Kanaliseringer- Nytt perspektiv på helse- Reiseskildringer- Alternativ bevissthet m.m.ILDSJELENmagazine for VITALITY, CONSCIOUSNESS and SPIRITUALITYIldsjelen is a Norwegian spiritual magazine.Ildsjelen is not bound to any religion or movement.Our issues come out once every two months (6 times a year).Our mission is to do what we can to change our world to a better place.We believe that the most powerful way to do that is through changing what we believe in,because that will change how we behave.We believe in a spiritual world and we believe our essence will go back to that world when our body dies. We believe everyone will come to the spiritworld without any exception. We also believe everyone is connected to each other far deeper than most people are aware of.Everything is changing, we change as human beings, but our spiritual understanding has not changed much in a very long time. We want to be a part of and inform people about the new spirituality we see emerging all over the world. In a way it is a revolution. This revolution/evolution is starting within the human being and spreading out as rings in the water.We do other things like publish and sell books, mostly Norwegian books but also some in English. In 2009 we arranged workshop and lecture in Bergen, Norway, with Neale Donald Walsch, author of all the books in the “Conversations with God”- series, and a renowned speaker all over the world.

The main interests of the Journal lie in publishing studies that further our understanding the pathophysiological and pathogenetic mechanisms of human disease.The Journal welcomes investigative studies on human tissues, in vitro and in vivo experimental studies, and investigations based on animal models with a clear relevance to human disease, including transgenic systems. In general, hypothesis driven studies that appropriately employ multiple investigative techniques are preferred over those that rely on a single methodology.As well as original research papers, the Journal seeks to provide rapid publication in a variety of other formats, including editorials, review articles, commentaries and perspectives and other features, both contributed and solicited.About the Society:The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland, is dedicated to enhancing high quality research and education in pathology in its broadest sense. The Society hosts a major conference twice a year with outstanding speakers on a range of topics from basic molecular pathology to diagnostic practice and provides a forum for investigators across the world to present their research.The Society also has a generous range of grants that it awards to its members including PhD studentships, scholarships and travel support.",参考,https://itunes.apple.com/cn/artist/wiley-publishing/id334132751,英文,The Journal of Pathology for iPad,免费,限4岁以上,2013年12月03日,需要 iOS 5.0 或更高版本。与 iPad 兼容。,1397366438,https://itunes.apple.com/cn/app/journal-pathology-for-ipad/id510043734?mt=8,5.0.2122,,

b:dreizehn GmbH,"»The Analytical Scientist« is a free monthly publication on the fields of analytical chemistry, including chromatography, spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and microscopy. We cover analytical science in part by exploring the hopes, fears, motivations and aspirations of the key figures in the field. Only through exploring why analytical scientists do what they do can we gain a full understanding of the subject. Inside each issue, you will find:  • A solutions-based approach that reflects the fact that analytical science is no longer just a series of individual techniques but a group of integrated and complementary methods.   • Coverage of the new approaches emerging at the interface of traditional techniques.   • Troubleshooting of real industry problems and case studies illustrating innovative approaches to improve performance.   • Legislation as it affects the analytical sciences.   • Business perspectives from the many industries that rely on analytical science.   • Advice aimed at senior researchers and managers in the analytical sciences, for example, how to manage your career, how to promote innovation within your team and how to run an efficient lab.   • Stories that relate analytical chemistry to real world events, for example, the Olympics, oil spills, food scares, biofuels. The Analytical Scientist is a publication for analytical scientists, not simply about analytical science.
